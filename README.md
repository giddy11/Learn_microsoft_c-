# All about Microsoft C# (`C#`)
With my struggles in C#, i decided to have a repository that has all concepts related to C# and because i will be learning other language and wont
want to lose track of my C# knowledge, i have decided to use this repo as my fall back to concepts i might have forgotten.

You are free to contribute to this, just ensure you read through [CONTRIBUTION.md](./CONTRIBUTION.md) to know how to contribute,
after reading about the particular project of interest.

There were 5 projects in all and I was supposed to get at least 3 of them done within the 4 weeks of internship, but as an [**ALX**](https://www.alxafrica.com/)
brought up, I chose to do them all. I thought it was a great opportunity to stand out, if indeed being an ALX SE student makes one stand out in the tech space.

There are 6 branches currently that focusses on areas in C#
***Below are things to take note of in my repo and is a link to how its been implemented or explained:***

## Code Challenges:
1. **Student Grading Application**: [Student Grading Application](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/master/Microsoft_C%23/Challenge_Project-1/Program.cs)

2. **Practical Use of Classes**: [tCard](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Hands_On_Challenges/Microsoft_C%23/ChallengeOne/Program.cs)

3. **Pallindrom Challenge**: [Pallindrom](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Functions/Microsoft_C%23/PallindromChallenge/Program.cs)

4. **Bank Account System**: [Bank Account Application](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/OOP/Microsoft_C%23/Code_Challenge/Program.cs)



## What you need to know about Functions
1. **Multi Values Return - Tuples Usage**: [Tuples - 1](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Functions/Microsoft_C%23/MultiValues_Tuples/Program.cs)

2. **Named and Default Parameters**: [Parameters - 1](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Functions/Microsoft_C%23/Named_Default_Parameters/Program.cs)

3. **Ref Out Parameter**: [ref out keyword - 1](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Functions/Microsoft_C%23/RefOutParameter/Program.cs)



## Object Oriented Programming
1. **Classes**: [Features of classes](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/tree/OOP/Microsoft_C%23/CLasseS) . In the link you can see [Inheritance](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/OOP/Microsoft_C%23/CLasseS/Inheritance/Book3.cs) , [Modifiers](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/OOP/Microsoft_C%23/CLasseS/Modifiers/Book1.cs) , [Properties](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/OOP/Microsoft_C%23/CLasseS/Properties/Book2.cs) , and [StringRepresentation](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/OOP/Microsoft_C%23/CLasseS/StringRepresentation/Book4.cs) .
This is the [Test Program](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/OOP/Microsoft_C%23/CLasseS/Program.cs) for the above classes, just uncomment the one that is applicable to the respective class

2. **Practical Use of Classes**: [tCard](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Hands_On_Challenges/Microsoft_C%23/ChallengeOne/Program.cs)

3. **Defining Classes, structs and Records**: In [here](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/C%23-essential-training-1/Microsoft_C%23/Linkedln.Essential/DefiningTypes.cs) we define the classes, structs and records have inheritance and the likes been displayed. To know how they behave, you can use the [test program](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/C%23-essential-training-1/Microsoft_C%23/Linkedln.Essential/Program.cs). To read more about their differences (i mean classes, structs and records) chech [this](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/C%23-essential-training-1/Microsoft_C%23/Linkedln.Essential/README.md)



## String Manipulation
1. **What is here**: In [here](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Topic/Strings/Microsoft_C%23/Strings_Study/Program.cs) we make use of getting the length of a string, accessing individual characters, iterating over a string like any other sequence of values, string concatenation, joining strings together with Join, string comparison, string searching and string replace among others.

2. **String Formatting**: [StringFormat](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Topic/Strings/Microsoft_C%23/String_Formatting/Program.cs)


3. **String Parse**: [StringParse](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Topic/Strings/Microsoft_C%23/StringParse_Study/Program.cs)

4. **String Builder**: [StringBuilder](https://github.com/giddy11/Learn_microsoft_cSharp/blob/Topic/Strings/Microsoft_C%23/StringBuilder_Study/Program.cs)
