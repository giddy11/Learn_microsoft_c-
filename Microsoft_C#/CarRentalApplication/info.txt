Constraints
Your program should meet the following constraints:

The user interface should be clear and easy to use. Use descriptive menu options and clear prompts to guide the user through the program.

The program should handle invalid user input gracefully. For example, if the user enters a non-existent car ID, the program should display an error message and return to the menu.

The program should be well-organized and easy to read. Use meaningful variable names, clear formatting, and comments to make your code easy to understand.

Your code should be properly documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality all important pieces of the code.
